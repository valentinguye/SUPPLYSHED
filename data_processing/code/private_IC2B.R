# Purpose of this script: integrate private data on cooperatives in the IC2B workflow.

# This script mirrors cam_v4.R in the making of IC2B for SEI-PCS Cote d'Ivoire cocoa v1.1. 
# BUT, it includes in addition not-open access (private) data. 

# So it first consolidates private data with already consolidated public disclosures, and then run the IC2B algoithms on the extended input data.

# --- COOP IDENTIFICATION, FROM NAMES AND COORDINATES -----------------------------
# Eventual goal is to have a unique identifier for cooperatives, based on abbreviated names, full names and coordinates information. 

# General rationale: 
# 1/ Pre-process identifying attributes
# 2/ We progressively impute missing information within groups of rows that show no sign of being distinct cooperatives.
# 3/ Then, we homogenize information within groups that show signs of being the same cooperatives.  
# 4/ Finally, we differentiate information between groups that show signs of being distinct cooperatives. 

## 2/ Missing imputation stage. 
# We impute missing information on one variable where there is a unique value for this variable within: 
# Step 1 - groups identified by one of the two other variables. 
#           Order matters here: imputations on a variable affect the next grouping. 
#           The non-missing variable we group on is thus full name, then coordinates, then abrv name, following the certainty with which these variables distinguish cooperatives. 

#           Since this process reduces the number of missing values in grouping variables, grouping can be more accurate on every iteration. 
#           Thus, we iterate the process until no more imputation is made. 
#           And we include Step 2 below in the loop, this is equivalent to looping once on Step 1 only first. 

#           Note: don't condition on the 3d var to be missing (as done initially), to allow for larger groups, which is more conservative
#           ... (spuriously giving the same name to rows with clearly distinct coords, but this is not an issue)

#           Note 2: to be most conservative, we don't impute missing coordinates based on either abrv or full name alone, 
#           ... because it would risk identifying several rows as a single coop, while they are actually 
#           ... different ones with the same coordinates (which is possible in the data, see Note 3 below). 
#           illustrative case:  civ %>% filter(grepl("COOPALBA", DISCL_SUPPLIER_ABRVNAME)) %>% View()

#           Note 3: We do not use coordinates as a bijective identifier of cooperatives. 
#           I.e., truly distinct coops may have identical coordinates, but truly identical coops cannot have different coordinates. 
#           Indeed, in many instances, there are very different names associated with identical/close coordinates. 
#           This is possibly the result of a "town-centroid" approach in the initial building of the Cocoa Accountability Map, 
#           ... resulting in truly distinct coops from the same area getting similar coordinates. 

# Step 2 - groups identified by identical-identical combinations of the two other variables. 
#           In practice, we apply this step only to the abrv-full name combination, 
#           ... because the two other combinations (abrv-coords and full-coords) are sufficient to identify a coop, 
#           ... and thus missings are directly filled in the homogenization stage (next). 

# We run steps in this order, and not the other way round, to maximize information used at each step
# (imputed rows in Step 1 become sufficiently filled to be picked up and filled in Step 2, 
# ... while the reverse order would directly upgrade rows with NA on 1 variable only, and thus not use them as information for imputations on rows with NAs on 2 variables). 


## 3/ Homogenization stage. 
# Arbitrarily choose a common name (abrv or full) for rows that share both the same other name (abrv or full) and the same coordinates.  
# This stage comes after and not before the missing imputation stage, to safely prevent this arbitrariness to alter the grouping in the imputation stage. 

# Finally, spot groups identified by coords and either abrv or full name, within which the other name (full or abrv resp.) is only NA. 
# Replace these NAs with the identifying name (abrv or full resp.). 

# In this stage, we use simplified abbreviated names and rounded coordinates,
# ... some rows may be the same coop but with different generic terms in the abrv name. 
# ... or because coordinates are not pointing to the exact same location. 
# (we do not use these in imputation stage, because the criteria there is to show no sign of being distinct cooperative)


## 4/ Differentiate distinct cooperatives, i.e. make a unique coop ID. 
# Based on imputed and homogenized abrv names, full names and coords. 
# There, we use even more rounded coordinates (1 digit), to distinguish homonym coops only if they are located in significantly different places (~10km apart). 


# Preliminary checks:

# So perhaps it's not crazy to rely on our imputation based on coop name homonyms instead and

#### Flow size extrapol. (sei-pcs) ------------------------ 
# Here, we impute the number of farmers, where missing. 

# Rationale: 
# Number of farmer  at the disclosure level is NOT representative of the coop, 
# ... but only of the disclosing company's sourcing volume.

# So we want to distinguish two things: 
# - the number of farmers that a company source from (for Trase)
# - the total number of farmers in a cooperative. 
# In Renier et al./ sei-pcs 2019, the assumption is that companies disclose farmers that supply them only, 
# ... and thus 2- is the sum of 1-. 

# First, impute missing cases where info is available from the same disclosing company the same year, but from a different source 
# (mostly, this is where the CAM has no info but additionally scraped data has it, 
# but we also change non-equal values to their average, to account for discrepancies btw. sources, eg. the CAM and new disclosures). 

# Note that we have chekced that there are no over-use of zeros in the disclosed number of 
# farmers, which would lead to under-estimating direct supply of traders not disclosing their number of farmers.
# That's only 2 coops from Cargill (and is consistent across the sources of info) 
# civ %>% filter(DISCL_NUMBER_FARMERS==0)

# # Imputed values are stored in THREE variables
# 1 - NB_FARMERS_COMPANY_YEAR has just the first kind of imputations (within the same company and coop)

# 2 - NUM_FARMERS is the variable for SEIPCS. It has the first kind of imputations PLUS the second kind of 
#     imputations (within the same coop, by averaging flow sizes disclosed by other companies with the same coop. In 2019 model, this was done in model script.
#     The rationale of doing this hezre is that we can use information within coop but across years, to get 
#     more conservative imputations before the third, more imprecise, step.   
#     The third kind of imputation is still made in SEIPCS models, by Monte Carlo. 

# 3 - NUM_FARMERS_EXTRAPOLATED has all three kinds of imputations; it is not meant for SEIPCS but for analyses that 
#     would use the output of this script directly (i.e. not after running the SEIPCS model).

# the same link has been disclosed but the farmer info hasn't. 
# (extension of links to years when they have not been disclosed *at all* occurs later in this script)

# we group by coop ID, company AND TRADER_NAME, to avoid using info on coop-manufacturer flows 
# (which could otherwise aggregate flows through several traders) to impute size of coop-trader flow.

##### 2nd kind of imputations #####

# Then impute within COOP_ID, in order to impute missings from values potentially disclosed by other companies

# companies, the sourcing from that cooperative was assigned the mean value of 
# the sizes disclosed by these other companies." in Renier et al.

# REMOVE DUPLICATES -----------------------------

# (as several companies may have disclosed to buy from the same coop), 
# but also the same link can come from different sources of disclosure data - typically, the previous CAM and data scraped by UCLouvain team). 

# We thus remove duplicates (i.e. make row ids) in 2 different ways: 
# 1- one row per coop per year (aggregating across links) - which is what we publish 
# 2- one row per actual link (aggregating across sources) - which is what is inputed in SEI-PCS. 

# (we DON'T try to make one row per sourcing flow (links to several companies that are on different stages of the supply chain are merged))
